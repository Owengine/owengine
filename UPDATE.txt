ABOUT
=============

Owengine is a powerful CMS forked from Oxwall Community Software. You will see the word Oxwall in the documentation, everything you see in there it is fully compatible with Owengine CMS.


REQUIREMENTS
=============

You need to have previously installed the latest Oxwall version or the latest Owengine version to make this update work. If you have an old version this update is not going to work.


BACKUP
========

Make a full backup of all files, directories, and your database(s) before
starting, and save it outside your Owengine installation directory.

CORE UPDATE
===========

Auto update:
Auto-update is all about clicking a button in admin area and entering your FTP details. We hope to make this feature run smooth on all possible server setups.

Manual update:
If autoupdate can't be applied you can try manual core update:

 - Download Owengine Update Pack at http://www.owengine.com/download;
 - Unpack it to the root folder of your software install;
 - Finalize update by calling http://www.yoursite.com/ow_updates

PLUGIN UPDATE
=============

Plugin update works pretty much as core update with possible auto- and manual updates. You should try auto-updates unless manual update recommended. Always read release notes from developers for special instructions before trying to update plugins.

THEME UPDATE
============

Currently, theme can be updated manually only. To update theme, follow these steps:

 - Besure that constant DEV_MODE is disabled in ow_includes/config.php file;
 - Download your current theme from our store;
 - Upload this theme to your site to ow_themes folder (overwrite existing theme);
 - After uploading was complete, enable DEV_MODE in ow_includes/config.php file;
 - Press F5 on any page of your site and disable DEV_MODE;
